linux distribution example :

1. ubuntu
2. debian
3. alpine
4. fedora
5. centos

'linux distribution' are also called 'linux distros'


Running ubuntu
------------------------
1. search docker hub --> ubuntu
2. terminal we can run > docker pull ubuntu
3. for running a distribution in interactive mode we can run >docker run -it ubuntu
4. after that the shell will appear in the console

Notes
- linux cmd are case sensitive
- linux we use forward slash as file separator
- using up and down arrows we can go to previous and latest commands
- history command for all the commands we have used
- in history all the used commands will be an ordered list
- in the shell we can type !* [where * is the SL of command] and can run that command



managing packages
--------------------
- apt is the package manager of ubuntu

- installing a package 'nano' which is a text editor
- to install nano in ubuntu
- we have to run > apt install nano

- to check all packages > apt list
- to update packages > apt update
- before installing a package we should first run > apt update

- for removing a pkg we have to run > apt remove <pkg-name>



- in linux everything is a file
- linux file system :
    /
        bin -- all binaries
        boot -- all boot related file
        dev -- all devices
        etc -- editable text configurations
        home -- home directory
        root -- home directory of root user
        lib -- keeping libraries/dependencies
        var -- files which we update frequently (e.g. logs)
        proc -- files that represents running processes

navigating files
---------------------------
> pwd -- to check current location
> ls -- for list of all files and folders
> ls -1 -- for seeing all files in line
> ls -l -- for seeing more description of files
> cd <path> -- for switching directories
> cd .. -- previous directory
> cd ../.. -- root directory
> cd ~ -- home directory

handling files
---------------
> mkdir test -- creates folder named 'test'
> mv test docker -- moving test into docker
> touch hello.txt -- creates a file
> mv hello.txt hello-docker.txt -- renaming the file
> mv hello.txt /etc -- moving file from current dir to etc
> rm file1.txt -- removes file
> rm file* -- remove all files that starts with 'file'
> rm -r docker -- removing 'docker' folder


editing files
--------------
> cat file.txt -- see content of file (short file)
> more file.txt -- see content of file (long file)
    disadvantage of 'more' -- we can't scroll up
> less file.txt -- see content of file (long file)
    advantage of 'less' -- we can scroll up and down with arrow keys
> head -n 5 file.txt -- can see first 5 lines
> tail -n 5 file.txt -- can see last 5 lines


redirection
------------
> cat file.txt > file_copy.txt -- can redirect the contents of file.txt to file_copy.txt
    here the '>' is the redirection operator
> echo hello > hello.txt -- if we read hello.txt it will print hello
>
